The project is configured using CMake (www.cmake.org), so please install it first.
Build files (Makefile for Unix systems, *.sln for Visual Studio) can be generated by the following commands for example:

    > mkdir build
    > cd build
    > cmake ..

Prebuilt binaries for Windows/MacOSX/Ubuntu are under ./bin.
Please refer to ./doc/readme.docx for a brief instruction on how to use the software.
